# ChooseYourDiet
It's a simple website for people to upload and rate food items with respect to their nutritional value. The idea is that people can upload something and rate it but it will be upvoted or downvoted by others so that anyone can know what is good for them to consume and what is not. Moreover, if someone is downvoted multiple times their posts will be less likely to be shared.
